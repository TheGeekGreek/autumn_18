\section*{Symplectic Geometry}
A profound difference between the tangent bundle $TM$ and the cotangent bundle $T^*M$ of a smooth manifold $M$ is that on the latter there exists a natural $1$-form, the tautological form $\alpha$ defined in definition \ref{def:tautological_form}.  

\subsection*{The Category of Symplectic Manifolds}
Recall that a form $\omega$ on a smooth manifold $M$ is said to be \emph{closed}, iff $d\omega = 0$.

\begin{definition}[Symplectic Manifold]
	A \bld{symplectic manifold}\index{Manifold!symplectic} is defined to be a tuple $(M,\omega)$ consisting of a smooth manifold $M$ and a closed nondegenerate $2$-form $\omega \in \upOmega^2(M)$, called a \bld{symplectic form on $M$}.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[The Cotangent Bundle]
	\label{ex:cotangent_bundle}
	Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and consider the tautological form $\alpha \in \Omega^1(T^*M)$ defined by $\alpha := \xi_i dx^i$ on a chart $\del[1]{T^*U, (x^i,\xi^i)}$ on $T^*M$. Define $\omega \in \Omega^2(T^*M)$ by $\omega := -d\alpha$. It is immediate that $\omega$ is closed since $d\omega = -(d \circ d)(\alpha) = 0$. Moreover, we compute locally
	\begin{equation*}
		\omega = -d(\xi_idx^i) = -\frac{\partial \xi_i}{\partial x^j} dx^j \wedge dx^i - \frac{\partial \xi_i}{\partial \xi_j} d\xi_j \wedge dx^i = \delta^j_i dx^i \wedge d\xi_j = \sum_i dx^i \wedge d\xi_i.
	\end{equation*}
	Thus $\omega$ is nondegenerate. 
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
	\label{def:symplectic_morphisms}
	A morphism $F : (M,\omega) \to (\wtilde{M},\wtilde{\omega})$ between two symplectic manifolds $(M,\omega)$ and $(\wtilde{M},\wtilde{\omega})$ is defined to be a morphism $F \in C^\infty(M,\wtilde{M})$ such that $F^*\wtilde{\omega} = \omega$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}
	Consider as objects symplectic manifolds and as morphisms the ones from definition \ref{def:symplectic_morphisms}. Show that they do form a category, the \bld{category of symplectic manifolds}.
\end{exercise}

\begin{definition}[Symplectomorphism]
	A \bld{symplectomorphism}\index{Symplectomorphism} is defined to be an isomorphism in the category of symplectic manifolds.
\end{definition}

\subsection*{The Tangent-Cotangent Bundle Isomorphism}
As in Riemannian geometry, one very important feature of a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ is that there is a canonical identification of the tangent bundle $TM$ and the cotangent bundle $T^*M$ (for the Riemannian case see \cite[341]{lee:smooth_manifolds:2013}). But first we recall some basic facts from the tensor calculus on smooth manifolds. 

%Input tensor fields

\begin{theorem}[{Bundle Homomorphism Characterisation Lemma \cite[262]{lee:smooth_manifolds:2013}}]
	\label{thm:bundle_homomorphism_characterisation_lemma}
	Let $\pi : E \to M$ and $\wtilde{\pi} : \wtilde{E} \to M$ be smooth vector bundles over a smooth manifold $M$. A map $\mathcal{F} : \upGamma(E) \to \upGamma(\wtilde{E})$ is linear over $C^\infty(M)$ if and only if there exists a smooth bundle homomorphism $F : E \to \wtilde{E}$ over $M$ such that $\mathcal{F}(\sigma) = F \circ \sigma$ for all $\sigma \in \upGamma(E)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proposition}[Tangent-Cotangent Bundle Isomorphism]
	\label{prop:tangent-cotangent_bundle_isomorphism}
	Let $(M,\omega)$ be a symplectic manifold. Define $\Omega : TM \to T^*M$ by
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:tangent-cotangent_isomorphism}
		\Omega(v)(w) := \omega_x(v,w)
	\end{equation}
	\noindent for all $x \in M$ and $v,w \in T_xM$. Then $\Omega$ is a well-defined smooth bundle isomorphism. The morphism $\Omega$ is called the \bld{tangent-cotangent bundle isomorphism}\index{Isomorphism!tangent-cotangent bundle}.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Using the tensor field characterisation lemma \ref{thm:tensor_field_characterisation_lemma}, $\omega$ induces a map 
	\begin{equation*}
		\omega : \mathfrak{X}(M) \times \mathfrak{X}(M) \to C^\infty(M)
	\end{equation*}
	\noindent which is $C^\infty(M)$-multilinear. Thus for $X \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$ we define $\Omega_X : \mathfrak{X}(M) \to C^\infty(M)$ by
	\begin{equation*}
		\Omega_X(Y) := \omega(X,Y).
	\end{equation*}
	Since $\omega$ is multilinear over $C^\infty(M)$, so is $\Omega_X$, and thus again by the tensor field characterisation lemma \ref{thm:tensor_field_characterisation_lemma}, $\Omega_X$ belongs to $\mathfrak{X}^*(M)$. Hence we get a map $\Omega : \mathfrak{X}(M) \to \mathfrak{X}^*(M)$ by $\Omega(X) := \Omega_X$ which is also multilinear over $C^\infty(M)$. Finally, by the bundle homomorphism characterisation lemma \ref{thm:bundle_homomorphism_characterisation_lemma}, there exists a smooth vector bundle homomorphism $\Omega : TM \to T^*M$ such that $\Omega_X = \Omega \circ X$ for all $X \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$. Let $x \in M$, $v,w \in T_xM$ and $V,W \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$ be extensions of $v$ and $w$, respectively (see step 3 in the proof of the tensor field characterisation lemma \ref{thm:tensor_field_characterisation_lemma}). We compute
	\begin{equation*}
		\Omega_V\vert_x(w) = \Omega_V(W)(x) = \omega(V,W)(x) = \omega_x(V\vert_x,W\vert_x) = \omega_x(v,w)
	\end{equation*}
	\noindent and since $(\Omega \circ V)\vert_x(w) = \Omega(V\vert_x)(w) = \Omega(v)(w)$, we have that $\Omega$ coincides with the map defined in (\ref{eq:tangent-cotangent_isomorphism}). Next we show that $\Omega$ is injective. Let $v,\wtilde{v} \in TM$ such that $\Omega(v) = \Omega(\wtilde{v})$. Since $\Omega$ is a fibrewise mapping, we must have that $v,\wtilde{v} \in T_xM$ for some $x \in M$. Moreover, by definition we have that $\omega_x(v - \wtilde{v},w) = 0$ for every $w \in T_xM$. By nondegeneracy, it follows that $v = \wtilde{v}$. Moreover, since $T_xM$ is finite-dimensional, we get that $\Omega$ is also surjective, thus bijective. Since any bijective smooth bundle homomorphism over $M$ is automatically a smooth bundle isomorphism by \cite[262]{lee:smooth_manifolds:2013}, $\Omega$ is a smooth bundle isomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
	In what follows, we will denote both the smooth bundle isomorphism $\Omega : TM \to T^*M$ as well as the induced $C^\infty(M)$-linear morphism $\Omega : \mathfrak{X}(M) \to \mathfrak{X}^*(M)$ by the same letter $\Omega$. However, as a subtle distinction between those two maps, we will write $\Omega_X$ for the evaluation of the latter at some $X \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$.
\end{remark}
