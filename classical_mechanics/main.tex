\chapter*{Preface}
This notes are the product of a semester project done at the \emph{ETH Z\"urich} in the autumn semester of $2018$ under the supervision of \emph{Dr. Ana Cannas da Silva}. I will roughly follow the first chapter of the book \emph{Quantum Mechanics for Mathematicians} by \emph{Leon A. Takhtajan} \cite{takhtajan:QM:2008}, which serves as an introduction to classical mechanics. Since this introduction is very brief, understandable by considering its purpose, I additionally rely on the classic \emph{Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics} by \emph{Vladimir I. Arnold} \cite{arnold:CM:1989}. As the title already suggests, this is not a treatment of the physical part of classical mechanics, but rather a mathematical one. Hence the aim of these notes is to give a thoughtful introduction to the mathematical methods used in the realm of classical mechanics and their strong connection to differential topology and differential geometry, especially \emph{symplectic geometry}. Therefore it is only natural to consider also the book \emph{Lectures on Symplectic Geometry} by \emph{Ana Cannas da Silva} \cite{silva:SG:2008}.\\
I would like to thank first of all my supervisor Dr. Cannas da Silva for granting me this opportunity of writing these notes, and also for introducting me to symplectic geometry back in the autumn semester 2017. Moreover, I would like to thank \emph{Prof. Dr. Will J. Merry}, whose brilliant lectures on \emph{Algebraic Topology} as well as \emph{Differential Geometry} helped me alot in understanding this and related subjects. Also, he was a great help in answering questions and clarifying concepts. A big help was also the marvelous trilogy of books from \emph{John M. Lee} (\cite{lee:topological_manifolds:2011}, \cite{lee:smooth_manifolds:2013} and \cite{lee:Riemannian_manifolds:1997}), which clear, thoughtful and highly formal exposition of the subject give an in-depth understanding of the matter. I won't deny the obvious: My style of writing and even the typeset of this document is highly inspired, sometimes even copied, from the style used by Jack Lee. The simple reason is, that I appreciate his work very much and try to achieve the same fineness. A prominent indicator of this fact is also the numerous citations of his books in these notes.\\
Lastly, I would like to thank both the mathematics institute at the \emph{University of Z\"urich} as well as the mathematics institute here at ETH Z\"urich, for teaching me mathematics. Without whom, maybe I would never have experienced the passion for doing mathematics. In this sense, happy reading (shamelessly ripped off the preface of \cite{lee:smooth_manifolds:2013})!\\

	\section*{The Differential of a Function}
	Recall, that if $M$ is a smooth manifold and $f \in C^\infty(M)$, then with respect to any chart $(U,x^i)$ on $M$ we have that
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:differential_of_a_function}
		df_x = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}(x)dx^i\vert_x
	\end{equation}
	\noindent for all $x \in U$ (see \cite[281]{lee:smooth_manifolds:2013}).

	\begin{proposition}[{Derivative of a Function along a Curve \cite[283]{lee:smooth_manifolds:2013}}]
		\label{prop:derivative_of_a_function_along_a_curve}
		Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold, $J \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ an interval, $\gamma \in C^\infty(J,M)$ a curve on $M$ and $f \in C^\infty(M)$. Then
		\begin{equation*}
			(f \circ \gamma)'(t) = df_{\gamma(t)}\del[1]{\gamma'(t)}
		\end{equation*}
		\noindent for all $t \in J$.
