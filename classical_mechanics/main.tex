\chapter*{Preface}
This notes are the product of a semester project done at the ETH Zurich in the autumn semester of $2018$ under the supervision of \emph{Dr. Ana Cannas da Silva}\footnote{Departement of Mathematics, ETH Z\"urich, R\"amistrasse 101, 8092 Z\"urich, Switzerland.}. I will roughly follow the first chapter of the book \emph{Quantum Mechanics for Mathematicians} by \emph{Leon A. Takhtajan} \cite{takhtajan:QM:2008}, which serves as a brief introduction to classical mechanics. Since this introduction is very brief, understandable by considering its purpose, I additionally rely on the classic \emph{Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics} by \emph{Vladimir I. Arnold} \cite{arnold:CM:1989}. As the title already suggests, this is not a treatment of the physical part of classical mechanics, but a mathematical one. Hence the aim of these notes is to give a thoughtful introduction to the mathematical methods used in the realm of classical mechanics and their strong connection to differential topology and differential geometry, especially \emph{symplectic geometry}.
