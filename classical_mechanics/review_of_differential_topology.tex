\chapter{Review of Differential Topology}
We follow the treatment as provided by \emph{Will J. Merry} in the year course \emph{Differential Geometry I and II} at the \emph{ETH Zurich} in the autumn semester 2018 and spring semester 2019, respectively. The course notes are available at

Additionally, we rely on \cite{lee:smooth_manifolds:2013}.
