\section*{The Inverse Function Theorem}

\begin{theorem}[The Inverse Function Theorem]
	\label{thm:inverse_function_theorem}
	Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ open, $f : U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ smooth and $x \in U$. If $Df_x$ is invertible, then there exists a neighbourhood $V \subseteq U$ of $x$ such that $f : V \to f(V)$ is a diffeomorphism.
\end{theorem}
