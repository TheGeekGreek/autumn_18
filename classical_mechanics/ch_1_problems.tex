\section*{Problems}

\begin{enumerate}[label = \thechapter-\arabic*.]
	\item \label{prob:1-1.} Adopt the theory developed in the section on the \emph{Legendre Transform} to the non-autonomous case, that is to the case of a Lagrangian system where the Lagrangian function can depend on time.
	\item Complete the proof of theorem \ref{thm:EL_equations} about the Euler-Lagrange equations. \emph{Hint:} Use the generalized notion of a \emph{fibrewise differential} established in problem \ref{prob:1-1.}
\end{enumerate}
